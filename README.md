# WMS_DSP_system

Hello! This repository contains a LabVIEW (2019, 64-bit) application dedicated to Wavelength Modulation Spectroscopy systems. The choice of LabView was influenced by the widespread use of this software in research groups conducting laser absorption spectroscopy research. The primary goal of this application is to perform digital signal processing of photodetector signals and measure gas concentration using the 2f/1f fitting method for scientific purposes.
The scripts consist of an engine for simulating WMS harmonics based on absorption characteristics (e.g., from the HITRAN database) and sensor parameters. The acquired signals should be processed by ADC cards compatible with the DAQ Assistant Express VI (the algorithm was tested with NI PXIe-6341). Following the successful acquisition of the signal from the photodetector, which should be a superposition of a scanning ramp and modulating sinusoid, the program calculates the first and second harmonics using a software Lock-In amplifier.
The application also allows the selection of appropriate FFT, averaging, and filtering parameters. Subsequently, the program normalizes the second harmonic (2f) by the first harmonic (1f) to enable calibration-free measurements independent of laser intensity fluctuations.
To properly implement the described method, the processing system utilizes two signals from the detection system: one from the path with the absorption cell filled with gas and another from the reference path without the absorber. Subsequently, employing algorithms to compare the measurement signal with the one obtained through numerical calculations, the error is determined by assuming the simulated gas concentration.
The process of comparison, error estimation, and recalculation is iterated until the error value decreases to an acceptable level, ensuring a correct concentration measurement within the adopted measurement error limits. It's important to note that the more simulations performed, the longer the measurement process takes.
Moreover, the application is equipped with a user-friendly GUI featuring buttons, interactive curves, and save/load options, making it suitable for deploying scientific TLAS systems.
